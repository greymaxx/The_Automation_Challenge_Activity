The Automation Challenge


1. The robot inputs all the excel data into corresponding input fields on the web page in the fastest possible time.
2. The fields will change location, size, selector and label position on the screen every time 'Submit' is clicked for all 50 excel rows. Therefore, the automation must accurately determine where each spreadsheet record must be typed every time.
3. Score 100% accuracy and earn a Certificate of Completion and earn your place on the leaderboard. The timer of the challenge will begin once you click the Start button.

P.S. Beware of the random reCAPTCHA pop-up.
